    <p>OHH its you zham kiki .<br/>  Happy that  we have been together for half a year now.<br/>
        By the way did you thought that i forgot todays day.???
        How could, I its a very special day for me.<br/>
        when I saw you for the first time i thought you were a just a noraml
        girl not knowing you would mean so much to me now.<br/>
        In this six months we had up's and down's ,yes we did 
        fought sometimes but the important thing is we got through it.<br/>
        Thank's for the reminder you always give when I forget that I have homework, for calling 
        me to have food with you, for worrying about me for spending time with me .IDK if I have done enough 
        for you but I try ,I dont want to be harsh and show bad behaviou but sometime I cant 
        control it and I just wanted to say sorry for all the harsh behavour and harsh things that I have said 

        to you.<br/><a href="./video.mp4">->NEXT </a>
